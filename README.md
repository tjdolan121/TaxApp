# Tax App

![Tax App](static/img/TaxApp.png?raw=true "Tax App")

#### CONTEXT: This is a tool I built for a client.

#### OVERVIEW:

#### In the world of personal investing, calculating your tax liability can be difficult.  Your tax liability is largely based off of your net capital gains.  Ideally, an investor would match annual capital gains to annual capital losses to ensure that their net capital gains is 0.

#### This may seem like a simple task: simply sell shares at the end of the year to match the two values.  But this is not ideal.  Perhaps you have to take a capital loss at the end of the year- but what if you don't have any shares you want to sell for a loss?

#### Things are further complicated by the accounting methodology used to calculate net capital gains, known as First In, First Out, or FIFO.  When you sell shares in a company, the cost basis for the oldest shares are used in the calculation, until those are depleted.  Then, shares from the next bucket are consumed.  Keeping track of these numbers can be onerous.

#### This app helps personal investors plan their stock trades ahead of time and see exactly where they will stand at the end of the year.

#### CONTRIBUTIONS:

#### This app will be deployed shortly and afterward, contribution instructions will be provided.
